# python-tkinter-studyapp
Study application written in Python using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. (WIP)

About
-
This is a personal UI project of mine to learn the Tkinter toolkit on Python. It is based on an assignment given on a university course about user interfaces. The assignment is to describe a database about students and their course records. In the application you can search students based on which year they started their studies or the minimum amount of ECTS. The program calculates the optimal structure for a Bachelor's degree for each student and color codes courses whether they fit in different degree structures.

The details of the current state of my project escape me. However, in its current form it is a work in progress and doesn't actually work. I want to finish it at some point and release a working version.
